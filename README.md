# SECL

SECL is a S-Expression based configuration language, drawing inspiration and syntax from JSON and YAML.

It's main goal is to provide a configuration format that is easy to read and write with little overhead while
being simple and understandable in it's syntax and parsing.


```
list-entry

key: (
    another-list-entry
    key: "Hello World!"
    explicit: "UTF-8 support: ðŸ’©"
    
    other-features: (
        "arbitrary precision decimals": 29312345320423531230497123416079652.234234234
        "and integers": 343287640123745610476123012734613047236402374620376234023746
        "scientific notation": 9.1*10^22
        "multi-line strings": "
            HELLO WORLD!"
        "omit quotation around simple strings": Hello-Again
        "load other files from subfolders": !(loadd "folder" ".conf")
        "empty maps": empty
        
        "random values": (
            randstr128
            maybe
        )
        
        "mix lists and maps, they are the same in SECL"
    )

    new-features: (
        "loading environment variables": !(env "SOME_ENV_VAR")
        "with defaults": !(env "SOME_ENV_VAR" default: "Default Value")
        "merge": !(merge
            (you can now merge several maps)
            (the list part is appended to the previous map)
            (keys: are added)
            (a merge will never change a datatype, it will only overwrite existing keys if their types match)
        )
        "loadd": !(loadd dir: "conf.d" suffix: "conf") // For when you need to load an entire directory of configs
    )
)
```

## Project Status

SECL is considered in Version 0.9

Most features are now part of the reference implementation in this repository. The last missing function is `loadd`, merge has been implemented recently.

A non-formal specification can be found at [hackmd](https://hackmd.io/s/rylGmiXr-) or in this repository under SPECS.md (hackmd might be more up-to-date than SPECS.md)

### Breaking Changes

Version `v0.9.5` will break serialization as the string type will now escape it's literal output on it's own. If you rely on Literal() to read a string, keep this in mind. This version also changes some semantics inside the parser which might lead to unexpected results in various applications but it should largely remain compatible with existing code. Additional this version removes the Position Information from String and Bool types as those values wheren't useful for development and complicated tests and code unnecessarily.

## Introduction

### Strings

Strings that do not contain any whitespace (as recognized by UTF8) and do not start with a digit or contain reserved character can omit quotation marks;

```
HelloWorld

```

Reserved characters: `"!@:()`

If any of the reserved characters is present, the string must be wrapped with quotation marks. Additionally, if the string equals
a keyword or function name, it must be wrapped with quotation marks too. (ex. "false" or "empty" or "randstr256")

```
"Hello World"
```

Strings are multi-line by default, if you want to trim leading whitespace from each line and the beginning of the string, prepend a `@` symbol.

```
@"
Hello 
 World"
 
// equivalent to

"Hello
World"
```

The special values `randstr` and `randstr32` to `randstr256` allow the usage of random strings in the config. This can be useful for security purposes like HMAC keys.

### Comments

Single-line comments are started using `//`, `#` or `;`

Multiline Comments are wrapped in standard C multline comment slashes. `/* comment */`

### Numbers

Numbers are divided into integers and floats with no predefined precision.

Integers must be noted as digits in full, leading digits may be used. `0x`, `0o` and `0b` are used for hexadecimal, octal and binary notation respectively.

Floats can be noted in normal decimal notation, exponent notation or scientific notation:

```
0.001
1e-3
1.0*10^-3
```

### Keys and Lists and Maps

A string with an appended `:` is a map-key. These can be virtually used everywhere except after another map key.

The item after a map key is added to the current Map-List as a Map item. If an item has no key, it is added to the current Map-List as a List item.

The top level of a SECL file is considered a Map-List. A new Map-List is started by a parenthesis and must be terminated by one:

```
outmost-map

(
    new-map-here
)
```

The keywords `empty` and `nothing` are equivalent to `()` for readability

Internally, there is no difference between an list (also known as array) and a map, both use the same datatype and list elements can be mixed into dictionary entries.

Lists **must** be sorted exactly in the order that is observed in the input file. The list resulting from `(a b c)` **must** have `a` as first element and `c` as last. 

### Booleans

There are three categories of keywords for booleans:

* true
* false
* maybe

The true category contains `true`, `yes`, `on` and `allow`

The false category contains `false`, `no`, `off` and `deny`

The maybe category contains `maybe`. This keywords randomly evaluates to either true or false with a 50.1% chance of being true.

## Functions

Functions provide programmatic functionality to SECL, some functions are built-in but you can add your own, custom functions via exec.RegisterFunction.

Currently implemented functions:

* `nop` - does not parse any parameter, returns Nil
* `env` - Accepts 1 string parameter and 1 named parameter, it reads the environment variable specified in the parameter and if empty, uses the named parameter `default:` instead, see `tests/test06-env.exec.secl` for an example
* `loadb` - Load binary data from a file
* `loadf` - Load a single file as SECL and return the result maplist
* `loadv` - Load single value (anything but a maplist) from a file
* `loadd` - Load all files with a specific extension from a folder, specify files and location with `dir:` and `suffix:`
* `decb64` - Decode base64 data
* `merge` - Merge several maplists into one maplist, it does not accept any parameters except maplists. Maplists are merged in order, it is not allowed to change a datatype of an entry.

## Planned Features

* `defmac` - Define Macros
* `defvar` - Define Variables
* `read` - Load a raw file string
* `parse` - Load CSV, JSON, YAML, TOML, SECL data into SECL (using `read` for input)
* `getnet` - Retrieve data from DNS and HTTP endpoints (ie, use TXT records to define configuration), usuable with `parse`
* `shell` - Execute Programs, read Stdout, Stderr or both

## Notes

### Merge Semantics

Merge will not change the data type of a map entry it is overwriting.

That means `!(merge (hello: world) (hello: 8))` is not valid and neither is `!(merge (hello: (world: 1)) (hello: world))`

Either one would mean that a query path would become invalid. This makes sure that an application can encode
query paths without having to worry about wether a imported config file will make them invalid.

## loadd Semantics

`loadd` outputs a map with the merge function that contains a list of the SECL files found.

If the files `file1.secl` and `file2.secl` contain the following:

```
--- file1.secl ---
key1: value1
!(nop)

--- file2.secl ---
key1: value2
key2: value3
```

Then the output of loading both files via loadd results in:

```
key1: value2
key2: value3
nil
```

Files will be sorted depending on how filepath.Glob outputs them, which is in lexical order, so
naming schemes like `10-config.secl` and `20-config.secl` will work as usual.
