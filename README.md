# SECL

SECL is a S-Expression based configuration language, drawing inspiration and syntax from JSON and YAML.

It's main goal is to provide a configuration format that is easy to read and write with little overhead while
being simple and understandable in it's syntax and parsing.


```

    another-list-entry
    key: "Hello World!"
    explicit: "UTF-8 support: ðŸ’©"

## Project Status

SECL is considered in Version 0.9

Most features are now part of the authorative implementation in this repository.

Missing features:
  
  * Hex, Octal and Binary Notation (`0x1F`, `0o777`, `0b110101`)
  * Float E and Scientific Notation (`2.3e18` or `2.3*10^18`)
  * Function Execution (Functions are recognized but not executed)

## Introduction

### Strings

Strings that do not contain any whitespace (as recognized by UTF8) and do not start with a digit or contain reserved character can omit quotation marks;

```
HelloWorld

```

Reserved characters: `"!@:()`

If any of the reserved characters is present, the string must be wrapped with quotation marks. Additionally, if the string equals
a keyword or function name, it must be wrapped with quotation marks too. (ex. "false" or "empty" or "randstr256")

```
"Hello World"
```

Strings are multi-line by default, if you want to trim leading whitespace from each line and the beginning of the string, prepend a `@` symbol.

```
@"
Hello 
 World"
 
// equivalent to

"Hello
World"
```

The special values `randstr` and `randstr32` to `randstr256` allow the usage of random strings in the config. This can be useful for security purposes.

### Comments

Single-line comments are started using `//`, `#` or `;`

Multiline Comments are wrapped in standard C multline comment slashes. `/* comment */`

### Numbers

Numbers are divided into integers and floats with no predefined precision.

Integers must be noted as digits in full, leading digits may be used. `0x`, `0o` and `0b` are used for hexadecimal, octal and binary notation respectively.

Floats can be noted in normal decimal notation, exponent notation or scientific notation:

```
0.001
1e-3
1.0*10^-3
```

### Keys and Lists and Maps

A string with an appended `:` is a map-key. These can be virtually used everywhere except after another map key.

The item after a map key is added to the current Map-List as a Map item. If an item has no key, it is added to the current Map-List as a List item.

The top level of a SECL file is considered a Map-List. A new Map-List is started by a parenthesis and must be terminated by one:

```
outmost-map

(
    new-map-here
)
```

The keywords `empty` and `nothing` are equivalent to `()` for readability

Internally, there is no difference between an list (also known as array) and a map, both use the same datatype and list elements can be mixed into dictionary entries.

Lists **must** be sorted exactly in the order that is observed in the input file. The list resulting from `(a b c)` **must** have `a` as first element and `c` as last. 

### Booleans

There are three categories of keywords for booleans:

* true
* false
* maybe

The true category contains `true`, `yes`, `on` and `allow`

The false category contains `false`, `no`, `off` and `deny`

The maybe category contains `maybe`. This keywords randomly evaluates to either true or false with a 50.1% chance of being true.
